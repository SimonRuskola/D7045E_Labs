/* Implement a shader class that takes a shader source code and a shader type, and
compiles it.
● The resulting GL Shader handle should be retrievable by a getter method.
● The shader code should be either a vertex shader or a fragment shader.
● The shader type states whether the code stands for a vertex shader or a fragment
shader. There should be a method that returns the type ((for instance, as an enum).
● Include error checking so a failed compile does not go unnoticed.  */
