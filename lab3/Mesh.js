/* ● Implement a class Mesh for meshes intended to be used when defining surfaces of
graphical objects.
● Apart from a graphics context, the constructor should take arrays with vertex and
index data describing the mesh, and create (via WebGL/OpenGL calls)
○ a Vertex Array Object handle,
○ a Vertex Buffer handle, and
○ an Element Array Buffer handle (index buffer).
● It also sets up vertex attribute pointers accordingly. */
